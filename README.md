# Activity 3: Authentication and CRUD with React Native and Firebase
Instructions: Implement a robust login and registration system with React Native, leveraging Firebase as the backend API. Incorporate essential form validation using Formik & Yup to ensure user input integrity, checking for null entries and incorrect values. Utilize your existing template and integrate fundamental authentication mechanisms to achieve a secure and seamless user experience and 0Auth authentication for Google and FaceBook. The CRUD process should be facilitated at the home page where you should be able to perform Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations over Todo Tasks.
